Another file for demonstrating grep CommaNd usage.
It allows us to fo CASE Insensitive string test
as well.
We can also do recursive SEARCH in a directory
using -R and -r Options.
grep allows to give a regular expression to 
search for a PATTERN.
Some special characters like . * ( ) { } $ ^ ?
are used to form regexp.
Range of digit can be given to regexp e.g. [3-6],
[7-9], [0-9]
